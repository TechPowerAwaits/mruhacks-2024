The game starts off with an unemployed man with no job. He is lazing around his house initially.
Something however inspires him to start cleaning up.
*sigh* "I really should get everything cleaned out. Maybe it'll make me feel better about myself..."
Now that the man has finally cleaned up everything in his house, he now decides he should head to school.
